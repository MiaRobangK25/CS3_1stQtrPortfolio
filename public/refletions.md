## `Is this really the end? No, it's just the START!`

# **1st Question**
> *List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.*

- 5 Topics I know very well (at least to me...)
1. `MarkDown` - I am confident in my skills to use MarkDown. It is very similar to how you format Discord messages, so translating it to CS3 was quite intuitive/fun! 
2. `Identify different JavaScript Display Possibilities` - I know how console.log(), window.alert(), document.write(), and other methods of how to evaluate input! Overtime, these display possibilities became more familiar-- where I feel confident in how to explain this to others. 
3. `If-Else, Switch` - I love these statements-- especially during my G8 C++ era. It is stuck in my head, especially how these statements are structured and work. The long hours and nights/mornings of understanding what was going on was WORTH IT!
4. `Break VS Continue` - The night I asked my 3rd Oldest Sister, Rhea, how to answer Sir Javi's coding task has stuck in my head. That grind at 3-4AM was definitely something I KNEW I needed. Afterall, I had a dream those two terms were attacking me...
5. `For/While Loops` - I have trauma from Grade 8. Those quizzes where I felt like I knew nothing, I did not understand much-- drove me to understand what exactly we were learning about. Until now, I've been WAITING for my redemption arc for these loops. 

# **2nd Question**
> *List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.*
- 5 Topics I know... to some degree...
1. `HTML & JavaScript` - I get really confused with the <> elements-- and what they do exactly. Sometimes I mix up the two, since when I integrate both HTML and Javascript-- usually I merge both by accident. My sense of organization gets so much worse when I have to deal with both of them...
2. `HTML Formatting/Designing` - I love designing. Although, I am very picky with my designs and how they look like. I often mix up different criteria/formatting conditions.. I am a very messy coder...
3. `Functions` - Functions are not intuitive to how my brain thinks. I was still confused in G8, and may still be a bit confused-- but I understand it BETTER now! Trust sir... 
4. `Interpretation of Code/Arithmetic snippets, or simply Operators...` - I am very careless, and often interpret codes very slow. But at times-- I do understand it! It's simply just I get confused easily with numbers- and often rely on my gut (even if it's wrong). 
5. `Fixing the errors in my code` - I am NOT a coder for a reason. Fixing errors is something that I can do, but I have a short fuse. I will rage at my code until it works, hoping that it hears me. 

# **3rd Question**
> *Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.*
- 

# **4th Question**
> *In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?*
