# **1st Question**
> *List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.*

- 5 Topics I know very well (at least to me...)
1. `MarkDown` - I am confident in my skills to use MarkDown. It is very similar to how you format Discord messages, so translating it to CS3 was quite intuitive/fun! This is especially true because I love formatting, and learning MarkDown was no issue. 

2. `Identify different JavaScript Display Possibilities` - I know how console.log(), window.alert(), document.write(), and other methods of how to evaluate input! Overtime, these display possibilities became more familiar-- where I feel confident in how to explain this to others. 

3. `If-Else, Switch` - I love these statements-- especially during my G8 C++ era. It is stuck in my head, especially how these statements are structured and work. The long hours and nights/mornings of understanding what was going on was WORTH IT!

4. `Break VS Continue` - The night I asked my 3rd Oldest Sister, Rhea, how to answer Sir Javi's coding task has stuck in my head. That grind at 3-4AM was definitely something I KNEW I needed. Afterall, I had a dream those two terms were attacking me...

5. `For/While Loops` - I have trauma from Grade 8. Those quizzes where I felt like I knew nothing, I did not understand much-- drove me to understand what exactly we were learning about. Until now, I've been WAITING for my redemption arc for these loops. 

# **2nd Question**
> *List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.*
- 5 Topics I know... to some degree...
1. `HTML & JavaScript` - As someone who thrives in organized chaos, I ocassionally get confused with the <> elements-- and what they do exactly. Sometimes I mix up the two, since when I integrate both HTML and Javascript-- usually I merge both by accident. My sense of organization gets so much worse when I have to deal with both of them...

2. `HTML Formatting/Designing` - I love designing. Although, I am very picky with my designs and how they look like. I often mix up different criteria/formatting conditions.. I am a very messy coder...

3. `Functions` - Functions are not intuitive to how my brain thinks. I was still confused in G8, and may still be a bit confused-- but I understand it BETTER now! It is also because I've been actively avoiding using functions, or coding using them in the first place. 

4. `Interpretation of Code/Arithmetic snippets, or simply Operators...` - I am very careless, and often interpret codes very slow. Although, at times-- I do understand it! It's simply just I get confused easily and overthink how dynamic JavaScript really is, therefore I often rely on my gut (even if it's wrong). 

5. `Fixing the errors in my code` - I am not a coder for a reason. Fixing errors is something that I can do, but I have a short fuse. I will rage at my code until it works, hoping that it hears me and it magically works afterwards. 

# **3rd Question**
> *Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.*
- My plans of action will go as follows (maybe the order might fluctuate-- depending on my list of priorities)...
1. `Always Ask for Help if I need it` --> hehe consult, sir... There are times I must acknowledge that I struggle with coding. It may be a simple syntax error, or I genuinely don't know how to approach a problem. I must always be open to asking for help! 

2. `Get Familiar/Understand different parts of the code` --> This is epecially true if I want to build the skill of debugging. I can't fix a code, or improve it if I don't know how it works in the first place. Therefore, one of my goals/plans of action must be to ALWAYS understand a problem before I try to fix it. 

3. `Practice More, know the code/how to format the code by heart` --> I can't keep relying on going to consult, or trusting my gut all the time. I must be able to work independently and have the skill to learn on my own (at some point). Even if I'm confused, I must have the drive to practice myself.  

# **4th Question**
> *In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?* 
- What I thought was effective...
1. `Bonus Activities` - These were really effective him helping us figure out how to design on our own! It's a bit difficult in my opinion if one were to teach how to style, since we all in our own unique way. These bonus activities were helpful in figuring out my style of designing/coding in HTML and/or Javascript. 

2. `The lesson/s where we went through different codes` - My answer to this is also similar to why I thought Bonus Activities were really effective. For this though, when we cycle through different styles/methods of coding-- it awakened my brain, Sir. In a good way, po of course-- since I'm very used to thinking of how to code in one method because of G8. Now, I feel more confident when I approach a coding problem because I can interpet it in different ways and how a code works in my head. 

- What I thought was a bit confusing, or what made my brain have an output error...
1. `Lesson with the Shovel Operator` - I'm pretty sure this was a skill issue on my end, but I wish we could have done something more with this lesson! I remember seeing the demonstration for different types of code, but this specific method confused me. I took note of it in my .js file, but I was quite confused with how it works exactly. Although, I'm pretty sure it's because I preferred the original/longer syntax we were taught since it felt more intuitive to me. 

2. `rli and rli.on` - Sir, I am not a big fan of this lesson regarding libraries and functions. It's a new lesson, but even after we discussed it I'm not confident in coding using these libraries. I wish we were able to familiarize/expose ourselves to more codes and/or how else we can use these libraries & functions.
