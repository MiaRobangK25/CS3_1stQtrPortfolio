# **1st Question**
> *Give 2-4 key points from the SONA 2025 that you found interesting*
- I found the overall tone and direction of his speech was interesting. You could tell from his delivery and content of his speech that 
`he wanted to sound progressive`-- or a leader of the future. Aside from that, I found the way he connected the statistics of what he accomplished 
to `what is special about his leadership/administration`. He also talked a lot about `what else he could do in the future if he had the chance`.

# **2nd Question**
> *Give 1-3 key points from SONA 2025 that you found weird for any reason (explaining is optional)*
- I found the fact that BBM was generally more focused on delivering the speech `"to the people, for the people"`. BBM also `seemed to avoid talking about international relations, or vaguely talk about PH trade relations`

# **3rd Question**
> *Write 2 paragraphs of reflection (each paragraph is ideally around 4 sentences)*
- I'll be honest-- I thought watching the SONA would be a good way to be updated in politics for debate while also receiving bonus points. 
However after watching the 1 hour speech, I do feel more interested to be updated about the PH status quo. There is so much more that I feel
I could understand-- or appreciate if I spent more time learning about how our democracy. Whether it be the tension between different politicians in the senate,
the progress our country made, or even general updates, they are truly interesting. 

- As a PISAY Scholar, it does feel like most of the time we are surrounded by academics that we don't have the time to get interested in much else.
We are actively surrounded by different lessons and people who teach us a certain perspective about a topic. Yet, we should also take initiative to
create our own perception of our environment and the state that our country is in. At one point, we may criticize the government in classes, the
way our political system works-- but who knows? We might become a politician in the future, or work for the government.

# **4th Question**
> *What 1 word/ phrase/ or sentence do you have for the Philippines after hearing SONA 2025?*
- As Gina Linetti from Brooklyn 99 once said, `"Life is chaos, success is completely arbitrary"`. We don't know what the future holds, and to find out--
all we can do is to wait & see how it turns out.
