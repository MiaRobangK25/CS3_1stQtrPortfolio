TO FLAG: I copied all of the lyrics from the song, TAKEDOWN in Kpop Demon Hunters.
HOWEVER-- for all the fancy text & styles, I asked help from ChatGPT. I only chose the colors & did simple alterations. 

I am but a fan of the movie, please spare me.

Takedown takedown  
Takedown down down down  
HUNTRIX girls to the world  
Takedown takedown  
Its a takedown  
Takedown down down down  

So sweet so easy on the eyes but hideous on the inside  
Whole life spreading lies but you cant hide baby nice try  
Im bout to switch up these vibes I finally opened my eyes  
Its time to kick you straight back into the night  

Cause I see your real face and its ugly as sin  
Time to put you in your place cause youre rotten within  
When your patterns start to show  
It makes the hatred wanna grow outta my veins  

I dont think youre ready for the takedown  
Break you into pieces in a world of pain cause youre all the same  
Yeah its a takedown  
A demon with no feelings dont deserve to live its so obvious  

Ima gear up and take you down  
Da da da down  
Its a takedown  
Da da da down  
Ima take it down  
Da da da down  
Its a takedown  
Da da da down  
Take it down  

Its a takedown Ima take you out you break down like What  
Its a takedown Ima take you out and I aint gonna stop  
정신을 놓고 널집 밟고 갈을 시겨놔  
Jeongsineul noko neoljip balgo gareul sigyeonwa  
Youll be beggin and cryin all of you dyin never miss my shot  

When your patterns start to show  
It makes the hatred wanna grow out of my veins  

I dont think youre ready for the takedown  
당당하게 어둠 엪에 다가서 다 무너뜨려  
Dangdanghage eodum epe dagaseo da muneotteuryeo  
Yeah its a takedown  
A demon with no feelings dont deserve to live its so obvious  

Ima gear up and take you down  
Da da da down  
Its a takedown  
Da da da down  
Ima take it down  
Da da da down  
Its a takedown  
Da da da down  

Oh youre the master of illusion  
나를 속이려 하지마  
Nareul sogiryeo hajima  
Look at all the masses that youre foolin  
But theyll turn on you soon so how  
How can you sleep or live with yourself  
A broken soul trapped in a nastiest shell  
용혼 없는 네 목숨을 근어러 and watch you die  
Yonghon eomneun ne moksumeul geuneoreo and watch you die  
You can try but you cant hide  

Its a takedown Ima take you out you break down like What  
Its a takedown Ima take you out and I aint gonna stop  
Ima cut you open lose control then rip out your heart  
Youll be beggin and cryin all of you dyin  

Ima gear up and take you down  
Da da da down  
Its a takedown  
Da da da down  
Ima take it down  
Da da da down  
Its a takedown  
Da da da down  

Take it down
