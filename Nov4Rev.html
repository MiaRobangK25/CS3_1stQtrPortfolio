background-repeat --> clarify: can be no-repeat, repeat-x (HORIZ), repeat-y (VERTICAL)

vertical-align –-> To change the vertical alignment of the element, this property is used. Its valid values could be top, middle or bottom. 
For other possible values of vertical-align you may refer to w3school.com.

text-indent –-> This property is used to set the indention of the first line of the text

letter-spacing –-> The space between the character of the text can be set using this property.

line-height –-> This property will set the space between the line of text.

word-spacing –-> The space between the words in a text can be set by this property.

text-shadow –-> this property adds shadow to text. (can be horizontal shadow, vertical shadow, blur effect and color)

font-style –-> To specify an italic text, this property is used

font-weight – This property sets the weight of a font. Some valid values are normal, bold, bolder and lighter.

font-size – This property sets the size of the text. 

COMMON UNITS 
Common units of the font size include px, em, %, in, cm, mm and pt. The px, in, cm, mm and pt are absolute length units. 
It means that they have fixed length. On the other hand, em and % are relative length units which specify its length depending on another length property.
(TAKE NOTEE OF THEM)

<a></a> --> visible, clickable text
<a href="page.html"> Click Here </a>

4 Pseudo-classes as well for LINK STATES

a:link – a normal, unvisiited link
a:visited – a link that the user has visited
a:hover – a link when the user mouses over it
a:active – a link the moment it is clicked

THIS IS THE BASIC CODE FOR NAVBAR.. to contain navigation links in ONE BLOCK like DIV & SPAN 
<nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="#news">News</a></li>
        <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
        <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
      </ul>
</nav> 

FLAG: When making STYLE for these it's 
ul{} --> general navbar style
li a:(pseudoclass){} --> that is VERTICAL & LISTEN
li{} --> for HORIZONTAL ORIENTATION (float: left) for eg. 

PSEUDO-CLASS SYNTAX
selector:pseudo-class 
{ property: value; } 

OR A DIV SYNTAX ONE FOR EXAMPLE

div.content:hover {
 color: #ff0000;
}

THIS IS FOR WHAT DIFFERENT SELECTORS DO/ARE 
selector:active --> Selects the active selector
selector:checked --> Selects all checked elements. Example is in checkboxes
selector:disabled --> selects all disabled elements. Example is in textboxes that cannot be edited or buttons that cannot be clicked unless an action is done
selector:focus --> Selects the element that has focus (i.e., a textbox where the cursor is currently at)
selector:valid --> Selects all elements with a valid value (i.e., a textbox for passwords with a valid input)
